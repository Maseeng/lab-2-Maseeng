# LAB 2: GEOPROCESSING USING PYTHON
Due: 7 April 2020
Arcpy was imported into Python to code.
Python was used to clip and buffer some shape files as follows: 
Portions of bike routes within a given area (in this case, a zip code) and that also fall within the buffer zone of certain facilities were the focus.
The objective is to keep only the bike paths that do not pose a hazard to the people frequenting the newly-arrived UN Building.
The head of the planning office has found some old GIS files for the plot of land and wants some help quickly, and visually, identifying portions of existing bike routes that may be problematic. 
A map of the analysis was exported to JPG, an image file to display the new bike routes in the Zip code area.
